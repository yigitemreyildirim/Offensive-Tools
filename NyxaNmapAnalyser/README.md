# 🚀 NYXA: AI-Powered Nmap Analyzer & Pentest Reporter

NYXA is an automated, all-in-one cybersecurity reconnaissance tool designed for Kali Linux. It executes native Nmap scans through a robust Python infrastructure and leverages either **Google Gemini Cloud API (Gemini 2.5 Flash)** or a local **Ollama (Llama3)** engine to instantly transform raw, messy network scan text into comprehensive, executive-level Penetration Testing Reports.

This tool is purpose-built for **CTF players, Junior Penetration Testers, and security students** who want to optimize their enumeration phase and master vulnerability identification with the help of Artificial Intelligence.

## 🛠️ Key Features

* **Four Distinct Scan Profiles:** Fast Scan, Comprehensive Scan, **Aggressive Mode (`-A -T5`) optimized for CTFs**, and a Custom Flags mode.
* **Intelligent Input Filtering:** Advanced regex sanitization that intercepts and strips accidental output flags (`-oN`, `-oX`, etc.) in custom mode, preserving the core automated pipeline.
* **Hybrid Dual-AI Architecture:** Automatically harnesses the cloud speed of Gemini API or seamlessly drops back to local **Ollama (Llama3)** based on user credentials.
* **Automated Firefox Integration:** If you don't have an API key, NYXA automatically opens Firefox and navigates to the official Google AI Studio to let you generate a free API key on the fly.
* **Standardized Markdown Output:** Generates clean, well-formatted English `.md` penetration testing reports ready for your portfolio or client delivery.

## 📋 Directory Architecture

To keep the codebase modular, highly readable, and maintainable, the project is divided into three distinct scripts:

```text
/opt/NyxaNmapAnalyzer/
├── app.py             # Main Entrypoint & AI Authentication Orchestrator
├── scanner.py         # Subprocess Automation & Native Nmap Handling
├── ai_engine.py       # Cloud/Local LLM Communications & Firefox Control
└── requirements.txt   # Third-Party Python Dependencies
```

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Installation Guide (For Absolute Beginners)

If you are brand new to Linux or cybersecurity, follow these steps exactly. Open your Kali Linux Terminal and copy-paste the following commands line by line:

### Step 1: Navigate into the Folder
```bash
cd /opt
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository Directly into /opt
```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/yigitemreyildirim/NyxaNmapAnalyzer.git
```

### Step 3: Navigate into the Project Folder
```bash
cd /opt/NyxaNmapAnalyzer
```

### Step 4: Install Python Dependencies Safely
```bash
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
```

### Step 5: If you have a Gemini API key,skip this step.(Runs correctly with at least 8 GB of RAM)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

ollama pull llama3
```

### Step 6: Execute the Analyzer Engine with Root Privileges
```bash
sudo python3 app.py
```

## 🎮 How to Use

### 1. Define Target
Enter your target domain or IP address when prompted (e.g., `192.168.1.X` or `scanme.nmap.org`).

### 2. Choose Scan Profile
Press `3` for rapid CTF enumeration or choose other options according to your scope.

### 3. AI Choice
* Type `yes` if you already have an API key and paste it.
* Type `no` to trigger the Automated Firefox Flow which will open your browser directly to the Google AI Studio page.
* Press **Enter** on an empty prompt to fall back entirely to your local environment; NYXA will spawn a brand new independent terminal window running `ollama run llama3` automatically.


### 4. Analyze Report
Check your workspace directory! A freshly generated `.md` file filled with service analyses, CVE cross-references, and remediation guidance is waiting for you.
